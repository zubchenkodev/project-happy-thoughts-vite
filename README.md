⭐️ Stretch Goals ⭐️

1. Page should follow the design as closely as possible ✅
2. The most recent thoughts at the top and older thoughts at the bottom (sorted) ✅
3. Thoughts should show the content of the message and how many likes they've received ✅
4. Form to post new thoughts ✅
5. The heart button to send likes on a thought ✅
6. Adapted to the different viewports ✅

⭐️ Intermediate Stretch Goals ⭐️

1. Show a count below the form input that updates as the user types and shows how many characters are remaining. Make it go red when the user has typed over 140 characters ✅

2. When POSTing a new thought, if the message was empty, too long, or too short, you get an error message back from the API. Use this to set some sort of `error` state to show a friendly message to your user:

❌ For very short or empty thought it is made. The situation with very long thought is handled not during the submitting the form, but during the typing in the textarea ( and submitting of form is blocked, if thought is too long)

⭐️ Advanced Stretch Goals ⭐️

1. Keep count of how many different posts you have liked (different from how many times a post has been liked). Keep count and display it in some way. You could even go as far as to store this number in localStorage so that when the page is reloaded, the initial state can be set from the number you've stored ✅
